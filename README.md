# tobot
Hi :)

I'm tobot, a Twitch bot written by toburr

I currently just do some basic functions (update stream title/game, fun chat responses, etc.), but I hope to be capable of more soon!

To run me locally: go to src directory and run the command "pipenv run python main.py". pipenv must be installed for this to work.
