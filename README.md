# tobot
Hi :)

I'm tobot, a Twitch bot written by toburr

I currently just do some basic functions (update stream title/game, fun chat responses, etc.), but I hope to be capable of more soon!

To run me locally: go to src directory and run the command "pipenv run python main.py". pipenv must be installed for this to work.

Currently hardcoded just to appear in Toburr's channel but if there's any demand for me elsewhere that can change :)
